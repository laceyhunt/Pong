# Pong
Pong in Unity
## Quick Launch:

1. Double click the `pong.exe` file to run the game.
   - Check "windowed" in the "pong configuration" menu for easier program closure.
2. Use your arrow keys to move your paddle (right) up or down to bounce the ball to your opponent (left).
3. At any time, click the "?" icon in the top right and a help menu will be displayed. From there, you can resume or restart your match or exit the game.
4. This game shows the score of each player at the top, but will never end unless you exit the game.

## Compiling the Code:

Updating the code will require a new build. Follow these steps if Unity is not already installed:

1. Download the .zip file from BBLearn.
2. Extract the contents of the zipped file into a new folder.
3. Download Unity from [https://store.unity.com/download-nuo](https://store.unity.com/download-nuo).
   - Follow the installation guide to complete the download.
4. Open Unity or start a new project if you haven't already.
5. Select the open file option in the top right corner.
6. Choose the folder where the zip files were extracted.
7. Unity editor for Pong should open.
8. In the top left corner, select `File -> Build & Run`.

**Note:** Unity creates additional files and folders that must be in the same directory as the Pong application for the game to run.
